## How Resolution Works

### For Each Pending Bet:

1. **Maturity Check**:
   - Only bets where `current time > maturity` are resolved
   - Bets not yet matured are skipped

2. **Price Comparison**:
   ```typescript
   finalPrice = getCurrentPrice(asset); // BTC or ETH

   // UP wins if price went higher
   if (direction === 'UP') {
     won = finalPrice > strikePrice;
   }

   // DOWN wins if price went lower or stayed same
   if (direction === 'DOWN') {
     won = finalPrice <= strikePrice;
   }
   ```

3. **PnL Calculation**:
   ```typescript
   payout_multiplier = 1.9x

   if (won) {
     pnl = amount * 0.9; // 90% profit
   } else {
     pnl = -amount; // 100% loss
   }
   ```

4. **Database Update**:
   - Sets `outcome` to 'win' or 'loss'
   - Sets `final_price` to current price
   - Sets `pnl_usd` to calculated profit/loss
   - Sets `resolved_at` to current timestamp

## Why Bets Were Stuck in "Pending"

### Problem
You placed Speed Markets bets, but they remained in "pending" status on the dashboard even after maturity.

### Root Cause
1. **No Automatic Resolution** - There's no background job running to auto-resolve bets
2. **Manual Trigger Required** - You must call the `/api/speedmarkets/resolve` endpoint
3. **No Dedicated Page** - There was no UI to view or manage Speed Markets bets

### Solution
✅ Created dedicated Speed Markets page
✅ Added "Resolve Bets" button for one-click resolution
✅ Shows all pending and completed bets
✅ Displays maturity countdown
✅ Added navigation link for easy access
