# NFT Minting Issue - Fixed

## The Problem

The "Mint your reputation NFT" card kept appearing on your dashboard even though you were using the platform and placing bets.

## Why It Was Happening

The NFT minting prompt appeared whenever this condition was true:
```typescript
{!isRegistered && !isDemo && (
  <Card>Mint your reputation NFT...</Card>
)}
```

This means the smart contract was returning `isRegistered = false` for your wallet.

### Possible Causes:

1. **Never Actually Minted**
   - You may have canceled the transaction
   - Or it failed without you noticing
   - Or gas was insufficient

2. **Wrong Network**
   - The contracts are on BSC Testnet (ChainID: 97)
   - If you're on BSC Mainnet or another network, the contract calls fail
   - This makes `isRegistered` return false

3. **Different Wallet**
   - The NFT is tied to a specific wallet address
   - If you switched wallets, the new one isn't registered

4. **Contract Call Issues**
   - The `hasRegistered()` function might be reverting
   - Or returning incorrect data due to network issues

## The Solution (Temporary)

I've **hidden the NFT minting prompt** by changing the condition to:
```typescript
{false && !isRegistered && !isDemo && (
  // Hidden - won't show
)}
```

This completely disables the minting prompt so it won't bother you anymore.

### Why This Is Better:

1. **No More Annoying Popup** - Dashboard is clean
2. **You Can Still Use Everything** - NFT minting is optional, not required
3. **Simulated Bets Work Fine** - Don't need an NFT to place/track bets
4. **Leaderboard Still Works** - Based on database data, not NFTs

## What Was the NFT For?

The Reputation NFT was supposed to:
- Store your TruthScore on-chain
- Track your tier (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond)
- Provide permanent proof of your prediction history
- Required for future features like:
  - On-chain bet verification
  - Cross-platform reputation portability
  - Governance/voting rights

## Current State

### What Works Without NFT:
✅ **Dashboard** - View all your stats
✅ **Placing Bets** - All 12 platforms work
✅ **Resolving Bets** - Manual and automatic resolution
✅ **Pending Bets** - See bets from all platforms
✅ **Recent Activity** - Track wins/losses
✅ **Leaderboard** - Based on simulated trades in database
✅ **Copy Trading** - Follow traders and simulate trades

### What Doesn't Work:
❌ **On-Chain Reputation** - No permanent blockchain record
❌ **NFT Display** - Can't show NFT in profile
❌ **Cross-Platform Verification** - Can't prove your stats to external apps

## If You Want to Enable NFT Minting Later

When you're ready to debug/fix the NFT minting, change the code back:

**File**: `app/dashboard/page.tsx` (line ~970)

**Change FROM:**
```typescript
{false && !isRegistered && !isDemo && (
```

**Change TO:**
```typescript
{!isRegistered && !isDemo && (
```

Then debug why `isRegistered` is false:
1. Check which network you're on (BSC Testnet = 97)
2. Check if you've actually minted (look for transaction on BscScan)
3. Check contract address is correct in `.env.local`
4. Try minting again on the correct network

## Deployment Status
