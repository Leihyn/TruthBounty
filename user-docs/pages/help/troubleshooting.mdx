## Wallet Connection Issues

### "Wallet not detected"

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-amber-50 dark:bg-amber-900/20 mt-2">
  **Symptoms:**
  - "No wallet found" message
  - Connect button doesn't respond
  - Wallet popup doesn't appear
</div>

<Steps>

### Check wallet extension

Make sure your wallet extension (MetaMask, etc.) is:
- Installed
- Enabled
- Unlocked

### Refresh the page

Sometimes a simple refresh fixes detection issues.

### Try a different browser

Wallet extensions work best on:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Brave

### Disable other wallet extensions

Multiple wallet extensions can conflict. Disable others temporarily.

</Steps>

### "Wrong network"

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-amber-50 dark:bg-amber-900/20 mt-2">
  **Symptoms:**
  - "Please switch to BNB Chain"
  - Transactions fail
  - Balance shows 0
</div>

**Solution:** Switch to BNB Smart Chain in your wallet.

<Callout type="info">
  **BNB Chain Settings:**
  - Chain ID: 56
  - RPC: https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org
  - Symbol: BNB
</Callout>

### "Connection rejected"

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-amber-50 dark:bg-amber-900/20 mt-2">
  **Symptoms:**
  - Connection popup appears then disappears
  - "User rejected the request" error
</div>

**Solution:**
1. Click connect again
2. Make sure to click "Connect" in the wallet popup
3. Don't close the popup too quickly

## Registration Issues

### "Registration failed"

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-amber-50 dark:bg-amber-900/20 mt-2">
  **Symptoms:**
  - Transaction fails
  - Error after confirming
  - NFT not received
</div>

**Possible causes and solutions:**

| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Insufficient BNB | Add more BNB for gas |
| Already registered | Check if you already have an NFT |
| Network congestion | Wait and try again |
| Gas price too low | Increase gas in wallet |

### "Already registered"

If you see this message, you already have a Reputation NFT. Go to your Dashboard to view it.

## Import Issues

### "No predictions found"

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-amber-50 dark:bg-amber-900/20 mt-2">
  **Symptoms:**
  - Import completes but finds 0 predictions
  - Empty import results
</div>

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Are you using the same wallet you trade with?
- [ ] Are you on the correct chain for that platform?
- [ ] Have you actually traded on that platform?
- [ ] Have your trades resolved (not pending)?

### "Import on cooldown"

Each platform has a 24-hour cooldown between imports.

**Solution:** Wait for the cooldown to expire. Check your Dashboard for remaining time.

### "Some predictions already imported"

This is normal! We prevent duplicate imports. Only NEW predictions since your last import will be added.

### "Import taking too long"

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-amber-50 dark:bg-amber-900/20 mt-2">
  **If import hangs:**
  1. Wait 2-3 minutes (large histories take time)
  2. Don't refresh or navigate away
  3. If nothing after 5 minutes, refresh and try again
</div>

## Score Issues

### "Score not updating"

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-amber-50 dark:bg-amber-900/20 mt-2">
  **Symptoms:**
  - TruthScore unchanged after import
  - Predictions imported but score same
</div>

**Possible reasons:**
1. **Predictions still pending** - Only resolved bets count
2. **Win rate decreased** - New losses offset volume gains
3. **Cache delay** - Wait a few minutes and refresh
4. **Small sample** - With few bets, each one has less impact

### "Score lower than expected"

**Common reasons:**

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 mt-4">
  <div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20">
    <h4 className="font-semibold m-0">14-Day Cap</h4>
    <p className="text-sm mt-2 mb-0">New accounts are capped at 50% for 14 days.</p>
  </div>
  <div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20">
    <h4 className="font-semibold m-0">Experience Scaling</h4>
    <p className="text-sm mt-2 mb-0">Under 50 predictions? Score is scaled down.</p>
  </div>
  <div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20">
    <h4 className="font-semibold m-0">Wilson Score</h4>
    <p className="text-sm mt-2 mb-0">Small samples are adjusted statistically.</p>
  </div>
  <div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20">
    <h4 className="font-semibold m-0">Win Rate Impact</h4>
    <p className="text-sm mt-2 mb-0">Low win rate limits score regardless of volume.</p>
  </div>
</div>

### "Score went down"

Currently, scores should only go up or stay the same. If yours went down:
1. Refresh your browser
2. Clear cache
3. Contact support if it persists

## Copy Trading Issues

### "Can't create vault"

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-amber-50 dark:bg-amber-900/20 mt-2">
  **Requirements:**
  - Must be Gold tier or above (TruthScore ≥ 1,000)
  - Must not already have a vault
  - Wallet must be connected
</div>

### "Deposit failed"

**Common causes:**
- Insufficient funds
- Not enough gas
- Below vault minimum deposit
- Network issues

**Solution:** Check balance, add gas, and try again.

### "Can't withdraw"

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-amber-50 dark:bg-amber-900/20 mt-2">
  **Possible reasons:**
  - Funds locked in pending trades
  - Not enough gas for transaction
  - Network congestion
</div>

**Solution:** Wait for pending trades to settle, then try again.

### "Trades not copying"

If you're following a leader but no trades appear:
1. Leader may not have traded recently
2. Check if vault is paused
3. Verify your deposit went through

## Transaction Issues

### "Transaction pending forever"

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-amber-50 dark:bg-amber-900/20 mt-2">
  **Options:**
  1. **Wait** - Network might be congested
  2. **Speed up** - Increase gas in wallet (MetaMask allows this)
  3. **Cancel** - Send 0 BNB to yourself with same nonce
</div>

### "Transaction failed"

Check:
- Sufficient BNB for gas
- Correct network (BNB Chain)
- Valid transaction data
- Not trying to do something impossible (e.g., transfer soulbound NFT)

### "Gas estimation failed"

This usually means the transaction would fail anyway. Check:
- You have funds
- You meet requirements for the action
- Network is functioning

## Display Issues

### "Page not loading"

<Steps>

### Hard refresh

Press Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

### Clear cache

Clear your browser's cache and cookies

### Try incognito

Open in a private/incognito window

### Different browser

Try Chrome, Firefox, or Brave

</Steps>

### "NFT not showing in wallet"

Some wallets need manual import:
1. Go to NFTs section
2. Click "Import NFT"
3. Enter contract: `0xa216b13c0b27b00c23552c768088fe11004d4b37`
4. Enter your token ID

### "Dashboard data outdated"
