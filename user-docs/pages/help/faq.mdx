# Frequently Asked Questions

Find answers to common questions about TruthBounty, organized by topic.

## General

### What is TruthBounty?

TruthBounty is a decentralized reputation protocol for prediction markets. We aggregate your trading history across multiple platforms, calculate a unified reputation score (TruthScore), and enable copy trading based on verified track records.

### Is TruthBounty free to use?

**Registration:** Free (you only pay gas for the transaction)
**Importing predictions:** Free (gas only)
**Copy trading:** 20% fee on profits (10% protocol, 10% leader)
**Everything else:** Free

### Which blockchains does TruthBounty support?

Currently, TruthBounty operates on:
- **BNB Chain** - Main platform, registration, NFT
- We import data from multiple chains: Polygon, Optimism, Base, etc.

### Is TruthBounty available in my country?

TruthBounty is a decentralized protocol accessible globally. However, users are responsible for complying with local regulations regarding prediction markets and cryptocurrency.

## Account & Registration

### How do I create an account?

1. Visit TruthBounty
2. Connect your Web3 wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.)
3. Click "Register"
4. Confirm the transaction
5. Receive your Reputation NFT

### Do I need to verify my identity (KYC)?

No. TruthBounty is fully pseudonymous. Your wallet address is your identity.

### Can I change my wallet address?

No. Your reputation is tied to your wallet permanently (soulbound). If you switch wallets, you'd need to start building a new reputation.

### What if I lose access to my wallet?

Unfortunately, losing wallet access means losing your reputation. This is why it's crucial to:
- Backup your seed phrase
- Use hardware wallets if possible
- Never share your private keys

## TruthScore & Reputation

### How is TruthScore calculated?

export const FormulaBox = () => (
  <div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20 mt-2">
    <p className="m-0"><strong>Formula:</strong> TruthScore = Win Rate × √(Volume)</p>
    <ul className="mt-2 mb-0">
      <li>Win Rate: Your prediction accuracy (0-100%)</li>
      <li>Volume: Total trading amount (with diminishing returns)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
)

<FormulaBox />

### Why is my score lower than expected?

Common reasons:
- **Account age:** 50% cap for first 14 days
- **Prediction count:** Score scales up to 50 predictions
- **Wilson score:** Statistical adjustment for small samples

### Can my score go down?

Currently, no. TruthScore only increases (or stays the same). Future versions may include decay for inactive accounts.

### How often does my score update?

Your score updates when:
- You import new predictions
- Pending predictions resolve
- You manually refresh

### What are the tier thresholds?

| Tier | Score Range |
|------|-------------|
| Bronze | 0 - 499 |
| Silver | 500 - 999 |
| Gold | 1,000 - 1,999 |
| Platinum | 2,000 - 4,999 |
| Diamond | 5,000+ |
