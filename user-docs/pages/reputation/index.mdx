## Components of Your Reputation

Your TruthBounty reputation consists of three interconnected elements:

### 1. TruthScore

A single number that represents your overall prediction ability. It's calculated from:
- **Accuracy:** How often you win
- **Volume:** How much you've wagered
- **Consistency:** Performance over time

### 2. Tier System

Your tier is a visual representation of your score level:

| Tier | Score Required | What It Means |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| Bronze | 0 - 499 | Just starting out |
| Silver | 500 - 999 | Building a track record |
| Gold | 1,000 - 1,999 | Proven predictor |
| Platinum | 2,000 - 4,999 | Expert level |
| Diamond | 5,000+ | Elite status |

## How Reputation is Built

export const ReputationFormula = () => (
  <div className="p-6 rounded-xl bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800 mt-6">
    <h4 className="font-bold m-0">The Reputation Formula</h4>
    <div className="mt-4 p-4 bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 rounded-lg font-mono text-center">
      Reputation = Accuracy × Volume × Time
    </div>
    <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4 mb-0 text-sm">
      This means you need both skill (accuracy) and experience (volume) to build a strong reputation. You can't game it with just one.
    </p>
  </div>
