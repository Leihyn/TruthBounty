# Your TruthScore

Your TruthScore is the single most important number in TruthBounty. It represents your overall prediction ability and determines your tier, ranking, and access to features.

## What is TruthScore?

TruthScore is a number that combines:
- **How accurate you are** (win rate)
- **How much experience you have** (trading volume)

The formula is designed to be fair - you can't game it by just making tiny bets or by betting huge amounts with poor accuracy.

## How It's Calculated

export const FormulaBox = () => (
  <div className="p-6 rounded-xl bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20 mt-4">
    <h4 className="font-bold text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-200 m-0">The TruthScore Formula</h4>
    <div className="mt-4 p-4 bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 rounded-lg font-mono text-center text-lg">
      TruthScore = Win Rate × √(Volume)
    </div>
    <p className="text-sm text-blue-700 dark:text-blue-300 mt-4 mb-0">
      Win Rate is your accuracy (0-100%), and Volume is your total trading amount.
      The square root of volume means bigger trades help, but with diminishing returns.
    </p>
  </div>

### Breaking It Down

**Win Rate Component:**
- If you win 60% of your predictions, your win rate is 60%
- This is the main driver of your score
- Accuracy matters most!

**Volume Component:**
- Uses the square root of your total volume
- This prevents whales from dominating purely by betting big
- Rewards consistent trading over time

### Example Calculations

| Trader | Wins | Total Bets | Win Rate | Volume | TruthScore |
|--------|------|------------|----------|--------|------------|
| Alice | 60 | 100 | 60% | 10 BNB | ~190 |
| Bob | 150 | 250 | 60% | 50 BNB | ~424 |
| Carol | 200 | 400 | 50% | 100 BNB | ~500 |
| Dave | 350 | 500 | 70% | 50 BNB | ~495 |

**Key insight:** Carol has more volume than Dave, but Dave's higher accuracy gives them a similar score!

## Score Multipliers & Caps

### Minimum Requirements

<Callout type="warning">
  You need at least **10 predictions** to appear on the leaderboard.
</Callout>

This prevents people from showing up with 3/3 wins (100% accuracy) from lucky bets.

### Experience Scaling

If you have fewer than 50 bets, your score is scaled down:
- 10 bets = 20% of full score
- 25 bets = 50% of full score
- 50+ bets = 100% of full score

This rewards experienced traders while still giving newcomers a path.

### New Account Penalty

Accounts less than 14 days old have a 50% cap on their score. This prevents fake account manipulation.

## Anti-Gaming Measures

TruthBounty uses several techniques to keep scores fair:

### 1. Wilson Score Confidence

Instead of raw win rate, we use a statistical method that accounts for sample size:

| Scenario | Raw Win Rate | Actual Score Used |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| 3 wins / 3 bets | 100% | ~44% |
| 30 wins / 50 bets | 60% | ~47% |
| 600 wins / 1000 bets | 60% | ~57% |

This means lucky small samples don't beat consistent large samples.

### 2. Square Root Volume Scaling

The square root function provides diminishing returns:

| Volume | Score Multiplier |
|--------|-----------------|
| 1 BNB | 1.0× |
| 10 BNB | 3.2× |
| 100 BNB | 10× |
| 1000 BNB | 31.6× |

Betting 10× more only gives you 3.2× more score, not 10×!

### 3. Duplicate Prevention

Each set of predictions can only be imported once, preventing artificial inflation.

## Improving Your TruthScore

### What Helps Most

export const ImpactGrid = () => (
  <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 mt-4">
    <div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-green-50 dark:bg-green-900/20">
      <h4 className="font-semibold text-green-800 dark:text-green-200 m-0">High Impact</h4>
      <ul className="mt-2 mb-0 text-sm">

        <li>Trading consistently over time</li>
        <li>Importing from multiple platforms</li>
        <li>Making 50+ predictions</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-900/20">
      <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-800 dark:text-red-200 m-0">Low Impact</h4>
      <ul className="mt-2 mb-0 text-sm">
        <li>Making huge single bets</li>
        <li>Trading a lot with poor accuracy</li>
        <li>Cherry-picking only winning trades</li>
        <li>Creating new accounts</li>
      </ul>

### Practical Tips

1. **Focus on accuracy first** - A 70% win rate beats high volume with 50% accuracy
2. **Be consistent** - Regular trading builds score faster than sporadic big bets
3. **Diversify platforms** - Import from all platforms you use
4. **Give it time** - The 14-day cap lifts eventually, patience pays off

## Checking Your Score

Your TruthScore is displayed:
- On your Dashboard (prominently)
- On your NFT (dynamically updated)
- On your public profile
- On the leaderboard

It updates automatically when you:
- Import new predictions
- When pending predictions resolve
- When you manually refresh

## Score History

Your score can go up or down over time:
- **Increases:** When you import wins or have winning predictions resolve
- **Decreases:** Currently, scores only increase (future updates may add decay for inactive accounts)

<Callout type="info" emoji="📈">
  **Your best strategy:** Focus on making good predictions consistently. The score will follow!
