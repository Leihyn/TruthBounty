# Improving Your TruthScore

Want to climb the leaderboard and unlock more features? Here's everything you need to know about boosting your TruthScore.

## The Fundamentals

Before diving into strategies, remember the formula:

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20 text-center font-mono mt-4">
  TruthScore = Win Rate × √(Volume)
</div>

This means you need BOTH:
- **High accuracy** (win rate)
- **Sufficient volume** (trading amount)

Neither alone will get you far.

## Quick Wins (Immediate Impact)

<Steps>

### Import All Platforms

If you've traded on multiple platforms, import them all!

- Each platform adds to your total volume
- More predictions improve your statistical confidence
- Diversification shows you're a well-rounded trader

### Wait Out the New Account Penalty

New accounts have a 50% score cap for 14 days. Just be patient:
- Day 1-14: Maximum 50% of calculated score
- Day 15+: Full score unlocked

### Reach 50 Predictions

Your score is scaled down until you have 50 bets:
- 10 bets = 20% of full score
- 25 bets = 50% of full score
- 50+ bets = 100% of full score

</Steps>

## Long-Term Strategies

### 1. Focus on Accuracy First

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-green-50 dark:bg-green-900/20 mt-4">
  **The Math:**
  - 55% win rate + 100 BNB volume = Score ~735
  - 65% win rate + 50 BNB volume = Score ~690
  - 70% win rate + 30 BNB volume = Score ~613

  **Insight:** Accuracy matters more at lower volumes. At high volumes, they balance out.
</div>

**Practical tips:**
- Don't bet on predictions you're unsure about
- Wait for high-conviction opportunities
- Keep track of what types of predictions you're best at

### 2. Trade Consistently

Consistent trading beats sporadic big bets:

| Approach | Weekly Volume | After 4 Weeks |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| Consistent | 10 BNB × 4 | 40 BNB total |
| Sporadic | 40 BNB × 1 | 40 BNB total |

Same total volume, but:
- Consistent trading shows reliability
- More predictions improve statistical confidence
- Regular importing keeps your score fresh

### 3. Specialize, Then Diversify

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 mt-4">
  <div className="p-4 rounded-xl border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700">
    <h4 className="font-semibold m-0">🎯 Phase 1: Specialize</h4>
    <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-2 mb-0">
      Master one platform or prediction type first. Get your win rate high before expanding.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div className="p-4 rounded-xl border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700">
    <h4 className="font-semibold m-0">🌐 Phase 2: Diversify</h4>
    <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-2 mb-0">
      Once consistent, add other platforms. This increases volume while maintaining accuracy.
    </p>
  </div>

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

<Callout type="error" emoji="⚠️">
  **1. Chasing Volume at Low Accuracy**

  Betting more with a 45% win rate will LOWER your score. Fix accuracy first!
</Callout>

<Callout type="error" emoji="⚠️">
  **2. Expecting Instant Results**

  The anti-gaming measures (new account cap, bet count scaling) reward patience.
</Callout>

<Callout type="error" emoji="⚠️">
  **3. Ignoring Platform Diversity**

  All your eggs in one platform means missing out on volume from others.

## Score Improvement Timeline

Realistic expectations for active traders:

| Timeframe | Typical Progress |
|-----------|------------------|
| Week 1 | Get registered, first imports |
| Week 2 | Hit 50 predictions, account still capped |
| Week 3 | Account cap lifts, score jumps |
| Month 1 | Bronze → Silver possible |
| Month 2-3 | Silver → Gold possible |
| Month 6+ | Gold → Platinum possible |
| Year 1+ | Platinum → Diamond (exceptional traders) |

<Callout type="info">
  **Reality check:** Diamond tier is rare. Most successful traders settle comfortably in Gold or Platinum. That's still excellent!
</Callout>

## Tracking Your Progress

### Daily
- Check your dashboard stats
- Note any new predictions to import

### Weekly
- Review your win rate trends
- Compare rank to previous week
- Identify what's working

### Monthly
- Analyze platform-by-platform performance
- Set goals for the next month
- Adjust strategy based on data

## Advanced: Score Optimization

For serious score hunters:

1. **Calculate your breakeven point**
   - At what win rate does your volume hurt you?
   - Focus on staying above that threshold

2. **Optimize import timing**
   - Import when you have batches of wins
   - The cooldown resets, so plan accordingly

3. **Cross-platform arbitrage**
   - Some platforms count wins differently
   - Understand how each platform affects your stats

## Summary: The Path to High Score

<div className="p-6 rounded-xl bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-50 to-purple-50 dark:from-blue-900/20 dark:to-purple-900/20 mt-6">
  **The Formula for Success:**

  1. 🎯 **Accuracy first** - Don't trade until you're confident
  2. 📊 **Volume second** - Scale up as accuracy stays high
  3. ⏰ **Patience always** - Let time work for you (14-day cap, bet scaling)
  4. 🌐 **Diversify eventually** - Add platforms when ready
  5. 📈 **Track and adjust** - Use data to improve
