### What It Means

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800 mt-4">

</div>

### What You CAN'T Do

- ❌ Transfer it to another wallet
- ❌ Sell it on OpenSea or other marketplaces
- ❌ Give it to a friend
- ❌ Burn it (it's permanent)

## FAQ

**What happens if I lose access to my wallet?**
Unfortunately, if you lose your wallet, you lose your reputation. This is why it's crucial to keep your recovery phrase safe. There's no way to recover or transfer a soulbound NFT.

**Can I have multiple reputation NFTs?**
No, each wallet can only have one TruthBounty NFT. This is enforced by the smart contract.

**Does the NFT cost gas to update?**
No! The NFT metadata is generated dynamically on-chain. When your score changes, the NFT automatically reflects the new value without any transaction.

**Will my NFT work on other chains?**
Currently, the NFT exists only on BNB Chain. Cross-chain reputation is being explored for future updates.
