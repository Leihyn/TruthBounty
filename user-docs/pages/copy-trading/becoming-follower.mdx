## Getting Started

<Steps>

### Check Requirements

**You need:**
- ✅ Any tier (even Bronze)
- ✅ Connected wallet
- ✅ Funds to deposit (BNB for BNB Chain vaults)

<Callout type="info">
  No minimum TruthScore required to follow! This is accessible to everyone.
</Callout>

### Find Leaders to Follow

Go to **Copy Trading → Find Leaders** to browse available vaults.

**What to look for:**

| Factor | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **TruthScore** | Higher = more proven track record |
| **Win Rate** | Accuracy of predictions |
| **Volume** | Experience level |
| **Platforms** | What they trade (PancakeSwap, Polymarket, etc.) |
| **Active Days** | How long they've been trading |
| **Followers** | Social proof (but don't follow blindly) |

### Review Their History

Click on a leader to see detailed stats:

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800 mt-2">
  **Check these carefully:**
  - Recent performance (not just all-time)
  - Win/loss distribution
  - Average bet sizes
  - Trading frequency
  - Worst drawdowns
</div>

### Deposit into Their Vault

1. Click "Follow" on the leader's profile
2. Enter deposit amount
3. Confirm transaction
4. Done! You're now copying their trades.

### Monitor Performance

Track your copy trading position from **Dashboard → Copy Trading**.

</Steps>

## Choosing the Right Leaders

### Green Flags

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-green-50 dark:bg-green-900/20 mt-4">
  <ul className="space-y-2 mb-0">
    <li>**Gold+ tier** - Minimum requirement shows commitment</li>
    <li>**Long history** - Many months of consistent results</li>
    <li>**Reasonable win rate** - 55-70% is realistic; 90%+ is suspicious</li>
    <li>**Regular trading** - Active traders, not one-hit wonders</li>
    <li>**Multiple platforms** - Diversified approach</li>
    <li>**Manageable drawdowns** - Even good traders have losses</li>
  </ul>
</div>

### Red Flags

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-900/20 mt-4">
  <ul className="space-y-2 mb-0">
    <li>**Too-good-to-be-true stats** - 95%+ win rate with high volume is unrealistic</li>
    <li>**Very short history** - Not enough data to trust</li>
    <li>**Huge recent losses** - Check if something changed</li>
    <li>**Erratic bet sizing** - Sign of emotional trading</li>
    <li>**Single platform only** - Less diversified</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## How Copying Works

### The Process

```
1. Leader decides to bet "BNB UP" with 1 BNB
2. Smart contract detects the trade
3. Your vault allocation copies proportionally
4. If leader wins, profits distributed to all followers
5. Fees collected on profits only
```

### Proportional Allocation

Your copy size depends on your deposit relative to the vault:

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20 mt-4">
  **Example:**
  - Total vault: 100 BNB
  - Your deposit: 5 BNB (5% of vault)
  - Leader bets: 10 BNB
  - Your copy: 0.5 BNB (5% of leader's bet)
</div>

## Managing Your Position

### Viewing Status

From your Dashboard → Copy Trading:
- Current balance
- Profit/loss
- Pending trades
- Recent copies

### Withdrawing

You can withdraw from a vault anytime:

1. Go to the vault page
2. Click "Withdraw"
3. Choose amount (full or partial)
4. Confirm transaction
5. Funds return to your wallet

<Callout type="warning">
  **Pending trades:** If there are unresolved predictions, that portion may be locked until they settle.
</Callout>

### Switching Leaders

Not happy with a leader's performance?

1. Withdraw from current vault
2. Find a new leader
3. Deposit into their vault

There's no penalty for switching!

## Diversification Strategy

Don't put all your eggs in one basket:

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 mt-4">
  <div className="p-4 rounded-xl border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700">
    <h4 className="font-semibold m-0">By Platform</h4>
    <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-2 mb-0">
      Follow leaders on different platforms:
      - One PancakeSwap expert
      - One Polymarket researcher
      - One sports betting specialist
    </p>
  </div>
  <div className="p-4 rounded-xl border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700">
    <h4 className="font-semibold m-0">By Strategy</h4>
    <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-2 mb-0">
      Mix different approaches:
      - Conservative (high win rate, lower risk)
      - Aggressive (higher risk, higher reward)
      - Balanced (middle ground)
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

### Sample Portfolio

| Leader Type | Allocation | Risk Level |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| Conservative crypto trader | 40% | Low |
| Event prediction expert | 30% | Medium |
| Sports betting pro | 20% | Medium |
| High-risk trader | 10% | High |

## Understanding Your Returns

### Profit Calculation

```
Your Profit = (Leader's Profit × Your Share) - Fees
```

### Fee Breakdown

On profits only:
- 10% → TruthBounty protocol
- 10% → Leader
- 80% → You!

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-green-50 dark:bg-green-900/20 mt-4">
  **Example:**
  - Your deposit: 1 BNB
  - Vault profit: 20%
  - Your gross profit: 0.2 BNB
  - Fees: 0.04 BNB (20%)
  - Your net profit: 0.16 BNB
  - Final balance: 1.16 BNB
</div>

### On Losses

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-amber-50 dark:bg-amber-900/20 mt-4">
  **No fees on losses!**

  If the leader loses:
  - You share in the loss proportionally
  - No fees are charged
  - You can still withdraw remaining balance
</div>

    <li>**Start small** - Test with a small amount first</li>
    <li>**Diversify** - Don't follow just one leader</li>

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-900/20 mt-4">
  <ul className="space-y-2 mb-0">
    <li>**Chase performance** - Recent winners may revert</li>
    <li>**Panic withdraw** - One bad day isn't a trend</li>
    <li>**Over-allocate** - Never risk more than you can lose</li>
    <li>**Ignore the data** - Trust numbers, not narratives</li>
    <li>**Expect guarantees** - Even the best traders have losing streaks</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## Troubleshooting

### "Deposit failed"

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-amber-50 dark:bg-amber-900/20 mt-2">
  **Possible causes:**
  - Insufficient funds
  - Not enough gas
  - Below vault minimum

  **Solution:** Check balance, add gas, or try a larger deposit
</div>

### "Withdraw pending"

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-amber-50 dark:bg-amber-900/20 mt-2">
  **Cause:** You have funds in pending trades that haven't resolved

  **Solution:** Wait for trades to settle, then withdraw
</div>

### "No copies happening"

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-amber-50 dark:bg-amber-900/20 mt-2">
  **Cause:** Leader hasn't traded recently

  **Solution:** This is normal during quiet periods. Check if the leader is still active.
</div>

## FAQ

**What happens if a leader stops trading?**
You can withdraw anytime. Consider finding a new leader.

**Can a leader see my identity?**
No. Leaders see aggregate vault stats, not individual followers.

**Is there a maximum I can deposit?**
Individual vaults may have caps. Check the vault details.

**What if the leader's strategy changes?**
Monitor regularly. If their approach shifts, reassess whether to continue following.
