# Simulation Mode

Not ready to commit real funds? Simulation Mode lets you practice copy trading with virtual money before going live.

## What is Simulation Mode?

<div className="p-6 rounded-xl bg-gradient-to-br from-purple-50 to-blue-50 dark:from-purple-900/20 dark:to-blue-900/20 mt-6">
  **Simulation Mode** = Copy trading with paper money

  Everything works exactly like real copy trading, but no real funds are at risk. Perfect for:
  - Testing strategies
  - Evaluating leaders
  - Learning the system
  - Building confidence
</div>

## Getting Started

<Steps>

### Navigate to Simulation

Go to **Copy Trading → Simulation Mode**

### Get Virtual Funds

You receive a starting balance of virtual currency (e.g., 10 simulated BNB)

### Choose Leaders to Follow

Browse and select leaders to follow with your virtual funds

### Watch the Simulation

See how trades would have played out over time

### Review Results

Analyze your simulated performance before committing real funds

</Steps>

## How It Works

### Simulation vs Real Trading

<div className="overflow-x-auto mt-4">
  <table className="w-full">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th className="text-left">Aspect</th>

### What's Simulated

Everything you'd experience in real trading:

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800 mt-4">
  - ✅ Leader trades are copied to your simulation
  - ✅ Proportional sizing based on virtual deposit
  - ✅ Win/loss results tracked
  - ✅ Fees calculated (simulated)
  - ✅ Performance metrics shown
  - ✅ Trade history logged
</div>

## Using Simulation Effectively

### Test Multiple Leaders

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20 mt-4">
  **Strategy:** Split your virtual funds across several leaders to compare:
  - Leader A: 30% of virtual funds
  - Leader B: 30% of virtual funds
  - Leader C: 40% of virtual funds

  After a few weeks, you'll see who performs best.
</div>

### Track Over Time

<Callout>
  Short-term simulation isn't meaningful. Run simulations for at least 2-4 weeks to get reliable data.
</Callout>

### Document Your Observations

Keep notes on:
- Which leaders are most consistent?
- How do they handle losing streaks?
- What's the typical drawdown?
- Are they active enough?

## Simulation Dashboard

Your simulation dashboard shows:

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 mt-4">
  <div className="p-4 rounded-xl border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700">
    <h4 className="font-semibold m-0">Overview</h4>
    <ul className="text-sm mt-2 mb-0 space-y-1">
      <li>Virtual balance</li>
      <li>Total P/L</li>
      <li>ROI percentage</li>
      <li>Active simulations</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div className="p-4 rounded-xl border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700">
    <h4 className="font-semibold m-0">Per Leader</h4>
    <ul className="text-sm mt-2 mb-0 space-y-1">
      <li>Virtual allocation</li>
      <li>Trades copied</li>
      <li>Win rate</li>
      <li>Profit/loss</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

## Transitioning to Real Trading

Ready to go live? Here's how:

<Steps>

### Review simulation results

Ensure you're happy with the leader's performance

### Start small

Begin with a smaller amount than you eventually want to invest

### Use the same leaders

Follow the leaders who performed well in simulation

### Monitor closely at first

Pay more attention during your first few real trades

### Scale up gradually

Increase your position as you gain confidence

</Steps>

<Callout type="warning">
  **Important:** Past simulation performance doesn't guarantee future real results. Markets can change, and real trading has additional factors (gas, slippage, timing).
</Callout>

## Limitations of Simulation

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-amber-50 dark:bg-amber-900/20 mt-4">
  **Be aware of these differences:**

  | Simulation | Reality |
  |------------|---------|
  | No slippage | Trades may have slippage |
  | Perfect timing | Slight delays possible |
  | No gas costs | Gas reduces net gains |
  | Psychological ease | Real money = emotions |
</div>

### The Psychology Factor

Simulation is low-stress. Real trading isn't:
- Losses feel more painful
- You might panic sell
- FOMO affects decisions
- Confidence can waver

Prepare yourself for the emotional difference.

## Resetting Your Simulation

Want to start fresh?

1. Go to Simulation Settings
2. Click "Reset Simulation"
3. All virtual positions cleared
4. Fresh starting balance provided

<Callout type="info">
  You can reset anytime to try new strategies or leaders.
</Callout>

## Simulation Tips

### Do's

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-green-50 dark:bg-green-900/20 mt-4">
  <ul className="space-y-2 mb-0">
    <li>**Run for several weeks** - Short tests are meaningless</li>
    <li>**Try multiple leaders** - Compare side by side</li>
    <li>**Track everything** - Notes help you remember insights</li>
    <li>**Be honest** - Would you really have held through that drawdown?</li>
    <li>**Simulate your actual budget** - If you have 5 BNB, simulate with 5 BNB</li>
  </ul>
</div>

### Don'ts

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-900/20 mt-4">
  <ul className="space-y-2 mb-0">
    <li>**Rush to real trading** - Patience pays</li>
    <li>**Ignore losses** - Learn from what doesn't work</li>
    <li>**Overfit** - One good week doesn't mean much</li>
    <li>**Skip the emotional prep** - Real money feels different</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## FAQ

**Do I need to connect my wallet for simulation?**
Yes, for tracking and to access the feature, but no real transactions occur.

**Can I simulate as a leader?**
Simulation is currently for followers evaluating leaders.

**Is there a time limit on simulation?**
No! Simulate as long as you need.

**Do simulation results affect my TruthScore?**
No. Simulation is completely separate from your real activity.

**Can I simulate multiple leaders at once?**
Yes! That's the best way to compare.
