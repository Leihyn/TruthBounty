# Copy Trading

Copy Trading lets you automatically follow top predictors or build a following of your own. It's the core social feature of TruthBounty.

## What is Copy Trading?

export const WhatIsCopyTrading = () => (
  <div className="p-6 rounded-xl bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-50 to-purple-50 dark:from-blue-900/20 dark:to-purple-900/20 mt-6">
    <p className="m-0"><strong>Copy Trading</strong> = Automatically replicating another trader's predictions</p>
    <p className="mt-2 mb-0">When a trader you follow makes a bet, the same bet is made on your behalf (proportionally sized).</p>
  </div>
)

## How It Works

### The Flow

```
Leader places bet → Vault detects → Followers' funds copy → Results distribute profits
```

### In Detail

1. **You deposit** into a leader's vault
2. **Leader trades** on their connected platforms
3. **Vault copies** the trade proportionally for all followers
4. **Profits/losses** are distributed based on deposits
5. **Fees** are collected (10% protocol, 10% leader on profits)

<Callout type="info">
  You always maintain control. You can withdraw from a vault anytime (subject to pending trades settling).
</Callout>

## Fee Structure

| Fee Type | Amount | When | Goes To |
|----------|--------|------|---------|
| Protocol Fee | 10% | On profits only | TruthBounty |
| Leader Fee | 10% | On profits only | The trader you follow |

export const FeeExample = () => (
  <div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-green-50 dark:bg-green-900/20 mt-4">
    <p className="m-0"><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <ul className="mt-2 mb-0">
      <li>You deposit 1 BNB</li>
      <li>After trading, you're up 0.5 BNB (50% gain)</li>
      <li>Fees: 0.05 BNB (protocol) + 0.05 BNB (leader) = 0.1 BNB</li>
      <li>Your take: 0.4 BNB profit</li>
      <li>Total balance: 1.4 BNB</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
)

<Callout type="warning">
  **No fees on losses!** You only pay fees when you profit.

## Common Questions

**Can I copy multiple leaders?**
Yes! You can deposit into multiple vaults to diversify.

**What if a leader goes on a losing streak?**
You can withdraw anytime. Consider spreading across multiple leaders.

**Do leaders know who follows them?**
Leaders can see aggregated vault stats but not individual follower identities.

**Is there a minimum to follow?**
Each vault sets its own minimum. Some may be as low as 0.01 BNB.
