| **Description** | Explain your strategy (optional) |
| **Minimum Deposit** | Lowest amount followers can deposit |

</Steps>

## How Leader Fees Work

### Fee Structure

When your followers profit:

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-green-50 dark:bg-green-900/20 mt-4">
  | Fee | Recipient |
  |-----|-----------|
  | 10% | TruthBounty protocol |
  | 10% | **You (the leader)** |
  | 80% | Your followers |
</div>

### Example Calculation

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20 mt-4">
  **Scenario:**
  - Your vault: 100 BNB from followers
  - You make a trade that profits 20%
  - Vault profit: 20 BNB

  **Fee Split:**
  - Protocol: 2 BNB
  - **Your fee: 2 BNB**
  - Followers keep: 16 BNB
</div>

### Fee Claims

Leader fees accumulate in your vault. You can claim them anytime:

1. Go to your vault settings
2. Click "Claim Fees"
3. Confirm transaction
4. Fees sent to your wallet

## Managing Your Vault

### Vault Dashboard

Your vault dashboard shows:
- Total followers
- Total value locked (TVL)
- Pending fees
- Recent trades
- Performance metrics

## Growing Your Following

### Building Trust

<Steps>

### Maintain Consistent Performance

Your stats are public. Steady, reliable returns attract followers more than occasional big wins.

### Be Active

Regular trading shows commitment. Inactive leaders lose followers.

### Communicate (Optional)

Consider sharing insights on social media or Discord. Explain your approach.

### Focus on Risk Management

Followers appreciate leaders who protect their capital during downturns.

</Steps>

### Attracting Followers

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20 mt-4">
  **What followers look for:**
  - ✅ Consistent win rate over time
  - ✅ Reasonable drawdowns
  - ✅ Regular trading activity
  - ✅ Clear strategy (even if not explained)
  - ✅ Verified on-chain stats
</div>

### Standing Out

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 mt-4">
  <div className="p-4 rounded-xl border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700">
    <h4 className="font-semibold m-0">🎯 Specialize</h4>
    <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-2 mb-0">
      Be the best at one thing rather than mediocre at many. "The PancakeSwap expert" is more memorable.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div className="p-4 rounded-xl border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700">
    <h4 className="font-semibold m-0">📊 Show Your Edge</h4>
    <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-2 mb-0">
      Your stats speak for themselves. Focus on metrics that matter: win rate, consistency, ROI.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

## Troubleshooting

### "Can't create vault"

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-amber-50 dark:bg-amber-900/20 mt-2">
  **Possible causes:**
  - Not Gold tier yet
  - Already have a vault
  - Wallet not connected

  **Solution:** Verify your tier and wallet connection
</div>

### "Trades not copying"

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-amber-50 dark:bg-amber-900/20 mt-2">
  **Cause:** Your trading wallet may not be linked to your vault

  **Solution:** Ensure you're trading from the same wallet that created the vault
</div>

### "No fees showing"

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-amber-50 dark:bg-amber-900/20 mt-2">
  **Cause:** Fees only accrue on winning trades

  **Solution:** Keep trading! Fees will accumulate when you profit.
</div>

## FAQ

Currently, one vault per wallet.

**What if I drop below Gold tier?**
