# Setting Up Your Wallet

A crypto wallet is required to use TruthBounty. This guide will help you set one up if you don't have one already.

## What is a Crypto Wallet?

A crypto wallet is like a digital identity card that lets you:
- Sign in to Web3 apps (like TruthBounty)
- Hold cryptocurrency (like BNB)
- Approve transactions

**Your wallet doesn't actually store money** - it stores the keys that prove you own your assets on the blockchain.

## Choosing a Wallet

  <Tabs.Tab>
    ### MetaMask

    **Best for:** Desktop users, beginners

    MetaMask is the most popular crypto wallet and works great with TruthBounty.

    <Steps>

    ### Create a New Wallet

    1. Click "Create a new wallet"
    2. Create a strong password
    3. **IMPORTANT:** Write down your 12-word recovery phrase on paper
    4. Store it somewhere safe (not on your computer!)

    ### Add BNB Chain Network

    MetaMask doesn't have BNB Chain by default. Add it:

    4. Enter these details:

## Getting BNB for Gas Fees

You'll need a small amount of BNB to pay for transactions on TruthBounty.

### Option 1: Buy BNB on an Exchange

1. Create an account on [Binance](https://binance.com), [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com), or another exchange
2. Buy some BNB (even $5-10 is enough to start)
3. Withdraw to your wallet address

### Option 2: Use Testnet (Free)

For testing, you can use the BNB Testnet with free test BNB:

1. Switch to "BNB Smart Chain Testnet" in your wallet
2. Go to the [BNB Faucet](https://testnet.bnbchain.org/faucet-smart)
3. Paste your wallet address
4. Click "Give me BNB"

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  **Testnet vs Mainnet:** Testnet is for practice. For real trading and reputation building, use Mainnet.
