Click on **"Dashboard"** in the navigation menu.

- **Gas Fee:** ~0.0001 BNB (varies)

Click **"Confirm"** in your wallet.

- Tier: Bronze
- A prompt to import your first predictions

</Steps>

## Your Reputation NFT

When you register, you receive a **soulbound NFT**. Here's what makes it special:

### What is "Soulbound"?

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20 border border-blue-200 dark:border-blue-800 mt-4">
  <p className="m-0">
    **Soulbound** means the NFT is permanently attached to your wallet. It cannot be:
  </p>
  <ul className="mt-2 mb-0">
    <li>❌ Transferred to another wallet</li>
    <li>❌ Sold on marketplaces</li>
    <li>❌ Given away</li>
  </ul>
  <p className="mt-2 mb-0">
    This ensures your reputation is truly **yours** and can't be bought or faked.
  </p>
</div>

### Dynamic Metadata

Your NFT automatically updates to show:
- Your current TruthScore
- Your tier (Bronze → Diamond)
- Visual changes as you level up

The higher your score, the more impressive your NFT looks!

## What Happens On-Chain

When you register, the following happens on the blockchain:

1. **Profile Created:** Your wallet address is registered in the TruthBounty smart contract
2. **NFT Minted:** A unique ERC-721 token is minted to your wallet
3. **Score Initialized:** Your TruthScore starts at 0
4. **Timestamp Recorded:** Your registration date is saved (affects some bonuses)

## After Registration

Now that you're registered, you should:
