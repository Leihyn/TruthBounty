# Beginner's Guide to Predictions

New to prediction markets? This guide will set you up for success with foundational concepts, safe practices, and realistic expectations.

## What Are Prediction Markets?

<div className="p-6 rounded-xl bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20 mt-6">
  **Prediction markets** are platforms where you bet on the outcomes of events. If you're right, you profit. If you're wrong, you lose your stake.

  Unlike gambling, prediction markets reward **skill and knowledge**. Good predictors consistently outperform random chance.

## Before You Start

### Mindset Check

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 mt-4">
  <div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-green-50 dark:bg-green-900/20">
    <h4 className="font-semibold m-0 text-green-800 dark:text-green-200">✅ Right Mindset</h4>
    <ul className="mt-2 mb-0 text-sm space-y-1">
      <li>"I'm here to learn and improve"</li>
      <li>"Losses are tuition fees"</li>
      <li>"Long-term consistency matters"</li>
      <li>"I'll only bet what I can lose"</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-900/20">
    <h4 className="font-semibold m-0 text-red-800 dark:text-red-200">❌ Wrong Mindset</h4>
    <ul className="mt-2 mb-0 text-sm space-y-1">
      <li>"I'll get rich quick"</li>
      <li>"This is easy money"</li>
      <li>"I can't lose"</li>
      <li>"I'll make back what I lost"</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

### Set Your Budget

<Callout type="warning">
  **Golden Rule:** Never bet money you can't afford to lose.
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Calculate your disposable income

What's left after bills, savings, and necessities?

### Allocate a small percentage

Most beginners should start with 1-5% of disposable income

### Set a monthly limit

Decide the maximum you'll deposit in a month

### Stick to it

No exceptions, no matter how "sure" a bet seems

</Steps>

## Your First Predictions

### Start Small

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20 mt-4">
  **Recommended starting stakes:**
  - PancakeSwap: 0.01 - 0.1 BNB per round
  - Polymarket: $5 - $20 per market
  - Sports: $5 - $10 per bet

  These amounts let you learn without significant risk.
</div>

### Choose One Platform

Don't spread yourself thin. Pick ONE platform to master first:

| Platform | Best For |
|----------|----------|
| 🥞 PancakeSwap | Chart readers, technical traders |
| 🔮 Polymarket | News followers, researchers |
| ⚽ Azuro/Overtime | Sports fans |
| ⚡ SpeedMarkets | Active traders |

### Focus on Learning

Your first month should be about:
- Understanding how the platform works
- Tracking every bet you make
- Noting what works and what doesn't
- NOT about making money

## Building Good Habits

### Keep a Trading Journal

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800 mt-4">
  For each prediction, record:
  - Date and time
  - Platform
  - What you bet on
  - Why you made this bet
  - Stake amount
  - Result
  - What you learned
</div>

### Review Weekly

Every week, look back:
- What's your win rate?
- What types of bets do you win most?
- What mistakes did you make?
- What will you do differently?

### Don't Chase

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-900/20 mt-4">
  **After a loss:**
  - ❌ Don't immediately bet bigger to recover
  - ❌ Don't get angry and bet randomly
  - ✅ Take a break
  - ✅ Analyze what went wrong
  - ✅ Come back with a clear head
</div>

## Understanding Odds

### Probability vs. Odds

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20 mt-4">
  **Probability** = Chance of something happening (0-100%)
  **Odds** = How much you win relative to stake

  | Probability | Decimal Odds | If You Bet $10 |
  |-------------|--------------|----------------|
  | 90% likely | 1.11 | Win $11 (profit $1) |
  | 50% likely | 2.00 | Win $20 (profit $10) |
  | 20% likely | 5.00 | Win $50 (profit $40) |
</div>

### Finding Value

Value exists when you think something is MORE likely than the odds suggest:

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-green-50 dark:bg-green-900/20 mt-4">
  **Example:**
  - Market says: 30% chance (odds 3.33)
  - You believe: 50% chance
  - This is a "value bet" - the expected return is positive

  Over many bets, value bets profit even if individual bets lose.
</div>

## Beginner Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Betting on Everything

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-amber-50 dark:bg-amber-900/20 mt-2">
  **Problem:** Treating prediction markets like entertainment betting on everything.

  **Solution:** Only bet when you genuinely believe you have an edge. Quality over quantity.
</div>

### 2. Ignoring Bankroll Management

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-amber-50 dark:bg-amber-900/20 mt-2">
  **Problem:** Betting 50% of your funds on one "sure thing."

  **Solution:** Never bet more than 2-5% of your total bankroll on a single prediction.
</div>

### 3. Confirmation Bias

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-amber-50 dark:bg-amber-900/20 mt-2">
  **Problem:** Only seeing evidence that supports your bet, ignoring contrary evidence.

  **Solution:** Actively look for reasons you might be wrong before betting.
</div>

### 4. Emotional Trading

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-amber-50 dark:bg-amber-900/20 mt-2">
  **Problem:** Betting when angry, excited, drunk, or after losses.

  **Solution:** Make rules for yourself. Step away when emotional.
</div>

### 5. No Record Keeping

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-amber-50 dark:bg-amber-900/20 mt-2">
  **Problem:** Not tracking bets, so you can't learn from patterns.

  **Solution:** Keep a simple spreadsheet or journal. Review regularly.
</div>

## Realistic Expectations
