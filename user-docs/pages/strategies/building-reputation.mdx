# Building Your Reputation

Ready to climb the ranks? This guide focuses on strategies specifically for improving your TruthScore and establishing yourself as a credible predictor.

## The TruthScore Formula

Understanding the formula helps you optimize:

<div className="p-6 rounded-xl bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20 mt-6">
  <h4 className="font-bold m-0">TruthScore = Win Rate × √(Volume)</h4>

  <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 mt-4">
    <div>
      <strong>Win Rate</strong>
      <p className="text-sm mb-0">Direct multiplier. 10% higher win rate = 10% higher score.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <strong>Volume</strong>
      <p className="text-sm mb-0">Square root. 4× volume = only 2× score boost.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  **Key insight:** Improving accuracy is more efficient than increasing volume.

## Strategies by Phase

### Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-14)

<Steps>

### Register and Get NFT

Complete the signup process and receive your Reputation NFT.

### Wait Strategically

Your score is capped at 50% for 14 days. Use this time to:
- Build your prediction history
- Learn platform mechanics
- Develop your strategy

### Import Everything

Connect all platforms where you've traded. Every bit of volume helps.

### Focus on Learning

Don't worry about score yet. Experiment, make mistakes, learn.

</Steps>

### Phase 2: Building (Weeks 2-8)

<Steps>

### Specialize

Pick ONE platform and prediction type. Become an expert.

### Optimize Win Rate

Your first goal: consistent 55%+ win rate. Don't increase volume until you hit this.

### Reach 50 Predictions

This unlocks 100% of your score potential. Critical milestone.

### Track Everything

Use a spreadsheet to track:
- Every prediction
- Why you made it
- What you learned

</Steps>

### Phase 3: Scaling (Months 2-6)

<Steps>

### Increase Volume Carefully

Only increase stake when win rate is stable.

### Add Platforms

Once you're consistent on one platform, expand to others.

### Maintain Quality

As volume grows, keep win rate high. Quality > quantity.

### Consider Leading

If you reach Gold, you can enable copy trading and earn fees.

</Steps>

### Volume Strategy

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20 mt-4">
  **Smart volume building:**

  | Win Rate | Volume Strategy |
  |----------|-----------------|
  | < 50% | STOP. Fix accuracy first |
  | 50-55% | Maintain current volume |
  | 55-60% | Gradually increase |
  | 60%+ | Scale aggressively |
</div>

### Multi-Platform Benefits

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-purple-50 dark:bg-purple-900/20 mt-4">
  Using multiple platforms:

  - Spreads risk across types

  **Recommended combinations:**
  - PancakeSwap + Polymarket (crypto + events)
  - Sports + Events (different analysis types)
  - Fast + Slow (short-term + long-term)
</div>

## Common Reputation Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Volume Without Accuracy

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-amber-50 dark:bg-amber-900/20 mt-2">
  **Problem:** Betting a lot with 45% win rate

  **Result:** Your score goes DOWN with every bet

  **Solution:** Stop trading, analyze, fix your strategy
</div>

### Pitfall 2: Impatience

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-amber-50 dark:bg-amber-900/20 mt-2">
  **Problem:** Frustrated by 14-day cap or slow progress

  **Result:** Risky bets, emotional decisions, setbacks

  **Solution:** Accept the timeline. Use waiting time productively.
</div>

### Pitfall 3: One-Dimensional Trading

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-amber-50 dark:bg-amber-900/20 mt-2">
  **Problem:** Only using one platform forever

  **Result:** Limited volume, missing opportunities

  **Solution:** Expand gradually while maintaining win rate
</div>

## Score Tracking

### What to Monitor

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800 mt-4">
  **Weekly check:**
  - Current TruthScore
  - Win rate trend
  - Volume this week
  - Rank changes

  **Monthly review:**
  - Score growth
  - Platform breakdown
  - Best/worst bet types
  - Goal progress
</div>

### Setting Goals

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20 mt-4">
  **Example goals:**

  | Timeframe | Goal |
  |-----------|------|
  | Week 1 | Complete registration, first import |
  | Month 1 | 50 predictions, 55% win rate |
  | Month 2 | Silver tier, 100 predictions |
  | Month 3 | Push toward Gold |
  | Month 6 | Gold tier, stable performance |
</div>

## Advanced Score Optimization

### The 55% Rule

<Callout type="info">
  At 55% win rate with any reasonable volume, you'll steadily climb. Below 55%, you stagnate or decline.
</Callout>

### Diminishing Returns

Because of the square root:
- Going from 10 to 20 volume: +41% score
- Going from 100 to 200 volume: +41% score
- Going from 1000 to 2000 volume: +41% score

Volume increases give the same % boost regardless of starting point.

### Break-Even Analysis

Calculate where volume starts hurting you:

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-amber-50 dark:bg-amber-900/20 mt-4">
  If your win rate drops as you increase volume:
  - 60% WR × √100 = 600 points
  - 55% WR × √200 = 778 points
  - 50% WR × √400 = 1000 points

  Sometimes trading MORE is worth lower accuracy. Do the math for your situation.
