## How Polymarket Works

Unlike fast-paced crypto predictions, Polymarket is about real-world events that take time to resolve.

<Steps>

### Browse markets

Find a question you have an opinion on:
- "Will X win the election?"
- "Will Bitcoin hit $100K by year end?"
- "Will SpaceX launch before July?"

### Check the odds

Each outcome has a price between $0.01 and $0.99. This represents the market's estimated probability.

**Example:** "Yes" trading at $0.65 means the market thinks there's a 65% chance.

### Buy shares

If you think the probability is wrong, buy shares:
- Think it's more likely? Buy "Yes" shares
- Think it's less likely? Buy "No" shares

### Wait for resolution

When the event happens (or doesn't), the market resolves:
- Winning shares pay out $1.00 each
- Losing shares are worth $0.00

### Profit or loss

Your profit depends on:
- The price you bought at
- Whether you were correct

</Steps>

## Understanding Polymarket Odds

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20 mt-4">
  **Price = Implied Probability**

  | Share Price | Implied Chance | If Correct, You Earn |
  |-------------|----------------|----------------------|
  | $0.10 | 10% | $0.90 per share (9x) |
  | $0.30 | 30% | $0.70 per share (2.3x) |
  | $0.50 | 50% | $0.50 per share (2x) |
  | $0.70 | 70% | $0.30 per share (1.4x) |
  | $0.90 | 90% | $0.10 per share (1.1x) |
</div>

The lower the price, the higher the potential reward (but also higher risk).

## Market Categories

### Politics & Elections

The most liquid markets. Elections, policy decisions, political events.

**Tips:**
- Polls have limitations - look at multiple sources
- "October surprises" can shift races dramatically
- State-level races often have more value than national

### Crypto & Finance

Bitcoin prices, ETF approvals, company announcements.

**Tips:**
- Regulatory decisions are hard to predict
- Crypto markets can be highly volatile
- Corporate actions often have insider leakage

### Sports

Game outcomes, championships, player performance.

**Tips:**
- Lines often similar to traditional sportsbooks
- Late news (injuries, weather) creates opportunity
- Unique markets (awards, milestones) may be mispriced

### Pop Culture & Entertainment

Awards shows, TV ratings, celebrity events.

**Tips:**
- Dedicated fans often have edges
- Industry insiders may have early info
- Unpredictable but fun!

## Understanding Your Polymarket Stats

### Win Rate Calculation

On Polymarket, win rate is based on market resolution:

```
Win Rate = (Markets You Won / Total Resolved Markets) × 100
```

<Callout>
  A position counts as a "win" if the outcome you bet on was correct, regardless of the entry price.
</Callout>

### Volume

Total USDC wagered across all markets. Multiple trades in the same market are summed.

### Profitability vs. Accuracy

For TruthBounty, we care about accuracy (were you right?), not profitability (did you make money?). This is because:

- A $0.95 position that wins is still a correct prediction
- A $0.05 position that loses is still incorrect
- The scoring system rewards being right, not just being profitable

## Troubleshooting

### "No markets found"

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-amber-50 dark:bg-amber-900/20 mt-2">
  **Possible causes:**
  - Wrong wallet (Polymarket uses your Polygon address)
  - Only have open positions (no resolved markets yet)
  - Very new account with no activity

  **Solution:** Wait for some markets to resolve, or verify wallet address
</div>

### "Markets still pending"

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-amber-50 dark:bg-amber-900/20 mt-2">
  **Cause:** Your positions are in markets that haven't resolved yet

  **Solution:** Only resolved markets count. Check back after your markets settle.
</div>

### "Different win rate than Polymarket shows"

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-amber-50 dark:bg-amber-900/20 mt-2">
  **Cause:** We may count things slightly differently (partial positions, canceled markets)

  **Solution:** This is usually a minor difference and doesn't significantly impact your score
</div>

## FAQ

**Does trading (buying and selling) count as multiple bets?**
We count your net position at resolution. If you buy and sell in the same market, only your final position matters.

**What about markets that get cancelled?**
Cancelled or voided markets don't count toward your statistics.

**How long until new markets are imported?**
We scan for resolved markets. Open positions won't appear until they resolve.

**What about my Magic Link account?**
As long as you know the Polygon address, you can import. The wallet type doesn't matter.
