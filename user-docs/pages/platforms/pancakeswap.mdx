PancakeSwap Prediction is one of the most popular crypto prediction markets. Every 5 minutes, you predict whether BNB price will go UP or DOWN.

## How PancakeSwap Prediction Works

<Steps>

### A round starts

Every 5 minutes, a new prediction round begins. You see the current BNB price as the "lock price."

### You place your bet

Before the round locks, you choose:
- **UP (Bull)** - You think BNB will go higher
- **DOWN (Bear)** - You think BNB will go lower

### Round locks

No more bets accepted. The price at this moment becomes the "lock price."

### Round ends

After 5 minutes, the final price is compared to the lock price:
- Price went UP → Bulls win
- Price went DOWN → Bears win

### Payouts

Winners split the losing pool (minus a small fee). Better odds = bigger payout!

</Steps>

## Tips for Better Results

### Do's

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-green-50 dark:bg-green-900/20 mt-4">
  <ul className="space-y-2 mb-0">
    <li>**Watch the trend** - Look at the last few rounds before betting</li>
    <li>**Check the odds** - Sometimes one side has much better payout</li>
    <li>**Manage your bankroll** - Don't bet more than you can afford to lose</li>
    <li>**Be patient** - Wait for high-conviction opportunities</li>
    <li>**Track your patterns** - Note which conditions you perform best in</li>
  </ul>
</div>

### Don'ts

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-900/20 mt-4">
  <ul className="space-y-2 mb-0">
    <li>**Don't chase losses** - Taking bigger bets after losses rarely works</li>
    <li>**Don't bet every round** - Selective betting wins long-term</li>
    <li>**Avoid high volatility** - Big news or announcements make prediction harder</li>
    <li>**Don't ignore gas** - Factor in transaction costs</li>
    <li>**Don't follow blindly** - Even top traders have losing streaks</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## Understanding Your Stats

### Win Rate

Your PancakeSwap win rate is calculated as:

```
Win Rate = (Winning Rounds / Total Rounds) × 100
```

<Callout>
  A 55%+ win rate is considered good on PancakeSwap. The best traders hover around 60-70%.
</Callout>

### Volume

Your total BNB wagered across all rounds. This contributes to your TruthScore.

### ROI (Return on Investment)

```
ROI = ((Total Winnings - Total Wagered) / Total Wagered) × 100
```

Positive ROI means you're profitable!

## Troubleshooting

### "No predictions found"

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-amber-50 dark:bg-amber-900/20 mt-2">
  **Possible causes:**
  - Wrong wallet connected
  - You haven't made any predictions on PancakeSwap yet
  - Predictions were made on a different chain (we only support BNB Chain)

  **Solution:** Double-check you're using the correct wallet address
</div>

### "Import on cooldown"

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-amber-50 dark:bg-amber-900/20 mt-2">
  **Cause:** You imported within the last 24 hours

  **Solution:** Wait for the cooldown to expire. You can see the remaining time on your dashboard.
</div>

### "Some predictions already imported"

<div className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-amber-50 dark:bg-amber-900/20 mt-2">
  **Cause:** We prevent duplicate imports

  **Solution:** This is normal! Only new predictions since your last import will be added.
</div>

## Maximizing Your TruthScore

To get the most TruthScore impact from PancakeSwap:

1. **Accuracy > Volume** - A 65% win rate with 10 BNB beats 50% with 50 BNB
2. **Consistency** - Regular trading shows reliability
3. **Import regularly** - Keep your stats up to date
4. **Combine platforms** - PancakeSwap + other platforms = higher score

## FAQ

**How far back can TruthBounty import?**
We can import your entire history from the beginning of PancakeSwap Prediction.

**Do cancelled rounds count?**
No. Only completed rounds with a clear winner are counted.

**What about the house edge?**
We calculate your win rate based on correct predictions, not profitability. The house edge affects payouts but not your prediction accuracy.

**Can I import from the CAKE prediction pool?**
Currently, we only support BNB predictions. CAKE may be added in the future.
